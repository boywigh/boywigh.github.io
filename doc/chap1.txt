<h2>Chapter 1<br />&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in my car and I was having my moment. I took a grasp of the outside world from the window. It is raining, but not so much that people are getting wet outside. It is not a crowded place. Here, where I live and may be the reason why I live here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One should find a place where they want to be and should stay there. Sometimes it is not possible to do that. Nevertheless, they should, once they get chance. One should stay with peace in mind and should find out what they want and should ask themselves, &ldquo;What I want and why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To live with one who you love is a dream of everyone. However, to live with one who loves you is heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere in the corner, there she stood and I saw her. The rain has almost stopped. I can see her very clearly, her tiny cute face, that round face with that wicked but a smile that I always fall for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after such a long time she hasn&rsquo;t changed. Or is it just me who wants to believe that? Or am I having another moment? I know I don&rsquo;t hallucinate during day, but what if that mild rain inside car with light crowd made me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows what goes in people&rsquo;s minds and hearts? What if I want to see that, and so I can see? Is it really happening? Should I stop and ask her? But what to ask? Isn&rsquo;t the past something one should avoid? Is living in past and thinking about the one to whom you wanted to be everything is wrong? What if I&rsquo;m not hallucinating? What if she is actually here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not like it can&rsquo;t be? &ldquo;Looks can be deceptive&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve always known that and it&rsquo;s easy to look for the one to whom you love in everyone who passes by. Everybody does that is something I believe. Everyone wants to believe something with all what they have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just turned back to confirm, but you can&rsquo;t just turn back to confirm if the girl you&rsquo;ve seen is the one who you want her to be or not when your wife is sitting with you, who loves you the way you used to love someone, to whom you are looking for in every passerby face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time the only thing to do to confirm is to ask her about something in such a way that forces her to her tell you to do what you want to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the possible ways that you can do that? My brain being a pessimist is very fast looking the options than a general brain, but the problem also comes with it. Being stubborn about the option that it chose as perfect being one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hot Chocolate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the option what I chose. I like it, she likes it and that she was near the restaurant. There couldn&rsquo;t have been a better option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s cold outside, just rained, we are in the car, she is outside, walking on the pathways. Let&rsquo;s hope I might find her and maybe we could chat. I don&rsquo;t know, if it is right thing to do, but, it is what my heart wants me to do. Hence, I&rsquo;m doing it. Not all the time, but, sometime to do such, I think that&rsquo;s what makes us human.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped near the Restaurant, I didn&rsquo;t find her. Me with my wife went inside restaurant. It is the very small restaurant, where me and my wife usually have our hot chocolate apart from when she makes at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a five table restaurant with a consistent small crowd, not so large to fill all table. It serves one of the best hot chocolates. It&rsquo;s not only the taste that brings people here but also the hospitality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All window glasses are covered with fog. Near one of the window, which opens to the little garden of the restaurant, there was a four-chaired table. A small but neither thin, nor fat, just the way I like it, she is sitting there with a thick book in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other. The calmness on face with a never-ending smile on her face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People do live the memory when they see what seems to have forgotten but stay with them as a soul. My wife went up to her and said hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does she know what I am thinking? I was scared. Is it normal to be scared in such situation? Or maybe, she doesn&rsquo;t know. Let&rsquo;s assume she doesn&rsquo;t know. After all, they are not strangers, we all went to the same college.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing I know I can do is act normal, assume everything is just mere a coincidence. I just went to them.</p>
